\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion-mpchecker}

In this paper, we propose \toolchecker, a multi-parameter constraint checker for Python data science libraries. \toolchecker utilizes both LLMs and symbolic execution to detect inconsistencies between code and documentation. 
To mitigate the uncertainty introduced by LLM outputs, we apply fuzzy constraint logic to accommodate nearly-correct parameter constraints. The experimental results show that \toolchecker is effective in identifying multi-parameter API documentation errors. We further reported 14 detected inconsistencies, 11 of which were confirmed by the development team.
Our work intuitively explores the multi-parameter constraint inconsistencies between code and documentation, and may inspire more future studies in this field.
