To cater to the requirements of various research endeavors, numerous outstanding datasets have been
made available to date. Just et al.~\cite{just2014defects4j} introduced Defects4J, a database
supplies actual bugs, fixed program versions, and corresponding test suites. Bui et
al.~\cite{bui2022vul4j} introduced Vul4J focusing on Java vulnerabilities. Jezek et al.
\cite{jezek2017api} released their dataset of compatibility issues arising from program evolution.
There are also many datasets cater for other research domains and
ecosystems~\cite{zhu2017dataset,wei2016taming,nielebock2021androidcompass}. 


Distinct from the previously discussed datasets, \toolcompsuite is the first dataset emphasizes the
incompatibility issues caused by Java library behavior changes. This type of issues are prevalent
and difficult to detect. Additionally, Our developed automated tools also have the capability to assist researchers in swiftly reproducing issues. We believe that a dataset targeting the library upgrade incompatibility
issue will contribute to the advancement of the associated technologies.
